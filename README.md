## 🚀 Backend Concepts & Implementation  

### 1️⃣ **Queued Email Notifications**  

#### **Problem Statement**  
- Sending **emails to thousands of subscribers** synchronously would slow down the system.  

#### **Solution**  
- Implemented **Laravel Queues** to **offload email sending to background workers**.  
- Job is triggered **only after the blog is fully stored**.  

#### **Workflow**  

1️⃣ **Admin Publishes Blog** →  
2️⃣ **`DispatchBlogNotificationJob` triggers** →  
3️⃣ **Fetches subscribers in chunks (1000 at a time)** →  
4️⃣ **`SendNewBlogNotificationJob` queues individual emails**  
5️⃣ **Queue workers handle email sending asynchronously**  

```php
public function store(BlogRequest $request)
{
    $blog = Blog::create($request->validated());
    DispatchBlogNotificationJob::dispatch($blog->id);
}
```

### 2️⃣ **Monthly Subscription Reset via Scheduled Job**
#### **Problem Statement**
- Users should get new AI article limits every month based on their subscription plan.
#### **Solution**
- Laravel Task Scheduling runs on the last day of every month.
- Free Users → Reset article count to 0.
- Subscribed Users → Reset to plan-specific limits.

```php
Schedule::command('articles:reset')
    ->when(fn() => now()->endOfMonth()->isToday())
    ->dailyAt('00:00');
```
### 3️⃣ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
#### **Problem Statement**
- Only Admins should manage categories & tags.
- Authors should only manage their own blogs.
- Guests should only read blogs.
#### **Solution**
- Implemented Policies & Middleware to enforce permissions.

```php
public function viewAny(User $user): bool
{
    return $user->role === 'admin';
}
```
### 4️⃣ **AI-Generated Blog Management**
#### **Problem Statement**
- Users should be able to generate AI blogs based on their subscription (limits applied).
#### **Solution**
- Used REST API with Laravel Sanctum for authentication.
- Enforced usage limits via middleware.

```php
if (!auth()->user()->canGenerateArticle()) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'AI quota exceeded'], 403);
}
```

## 🔑 **Key Learnings**
- **Queues →** Handling large-scale email sending efficiently.
- **Task Scheduling →** Automating recurring backend tasks.
- **Role-Based Authorization →** Restricting admin/author access.
- **Database Optimization →** Handling large-scale blogs & subscribers efficiently.
